# Barchart

    Bar charts are useful when you want to compare a single metric for different entitiesâ€”for example, the number of cars sold by different companies or the number of people in certain age groups in a town. You can create bar charts in Chart.js by setting the type key to bar. By default, this will create charts with vertical bars. If you want to create charts with horizontal bars, you will have to set the type.
